# Deep learning network accuracy / efficiency tradeoff diagrams

TODO:
- [ ] Provide code to get accuracy and efficiency metrics
- [ ] Reorder COCO classes so the most interesting will go first: "person", "cat", etc.
- [ ] Size of scatter points depends on model size

## How to add a new network?

Set of models is based on [Open Mozel Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo).
